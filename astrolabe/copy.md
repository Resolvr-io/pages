### Uncorrelated Returns

Escape crypto market volatility. Risk asset returns are driven by natural events and standard insurance risk, which have zero correlation to bitcoin price action or DeFi lending cycles.

### Real-World Yield

Earn yield derived from actual insurance premiums. This is a share of the profitable global reinsurance market, not inflationary token rewards.

### Bitcoin-Native

Invest bitcoin and receive the coupon and principal in bitcoin. Your capital stays in the asset you believe in, while working to generate more of it.

### Radical Transparency

Unlike traditional reinsurance funds, the Astrolabe Risk Asset Marketplace utilizes on-chain covenants. You can cryptographically verify that your collateral is held in the correct reserve address at all times.

### Atomic Liquidity

Tokenized risk asset notes can be traded on secondary markets or peer-to-peer using atomic swaps, offering superior liquidity to traditional multi-year reinsurance contracts.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Everything you need to know about investing in the Astrolabe Risk Asset Marketplace

### The Fundamentals

**Where does my bitcoin go if I buy a risk asset? (AKA "Who's holding my bitcoin"?)**

Unlike traditional reinsurance where capital is wired to a trustee-managed bank account, your bitcoin is held in a smart contract on the Liquid Network. Specifically, the funds are locked in a programmatic escrow enforced by SimplicityHL code. The capital is strictly bound by the contract's logic: it can only be moved to the investor (upon maturity/redemption) or to the cedent (if a verified disaster occurs). This eliminates the need for a central custodian to hold the funds, offering near-zero counterparty risk regarding the safety of the collateral.

**Where does the yield come from?**

The yield is derived entirely from insurance premiums, not from crypto-lending, staking, or inflationary token emissions. Global insurers and corporations pay significant premiums to transfer the risk of catastrophic events (like hurricanes or earthquakes) to the capital markets. As an investor, you are acting as the reinsurer. You provide the collateral to back these risks, and in exchange, you receive the premiums paid by the coverage buyer. This results in a yield that is structurally uncorrelated to bitcoin price action or interest rates.

**Is the yield paid in bitcoin or fiat?**

The product is bitcoin-native. You invest in L-BTC (Liquid Bitcoin), and both the coupons (premiums) and the principal repayment are denominated and settled in L-BTC. This allows you to eliminate currency risk and keep your capital in the asset you believe in.

### Access & Eligibility

**Who can invest in these securities?**

Due to the regulatory nature of securities and insurance, this product is available only to accredited and institutional investors who have been whitelisted by Astrolabe. While the risk asset is unilaterally redeemable for L-BTC upon maturity, the issuance and movement of the risk asset before then is gated and permissioned by Astrolabe. You must undergo a standard KYC/AML process to be authorized to participate in the primary issuance or secondary trades.

### Technology & Security

**How is this different from other smart contract platforms (e.g., Ethereum/Solidity)?**

The Astrolabe Risk Asset Marketplace is built on the Liquid Network, a Bitcoin sidechain, using SimplicityHL (High-Level Simplicity). This differs from EVM-based platforms (like Ethereum) in two critical ways:

1. **Safety & Auditability:** Simplicity is designed to be formally verifiable, significantly reducing the risk of bugs, hacks, or "rug pulls" common in Solidity-based contracts.
2. **bitcoin-Native Architecture:** The contract uses a UTXO-based model (similar to Bitcoin) rather than an Account model. This allows for precise state management where the token supply and the backing collateral are mathematically linked and move in lockstep, ensuring the token supply always matches the backing collateral.

**How is a payout triggered?**

Payouts are not decided by a human claims adjuster but are automated via an Oracle. The specific conditions (e.g., "Wind speed > 130mph in Florida") are pre-coded into the Note. A designated "Claim Oracle" (a trusted third party or federation) broadcasts signed data to the network. If the data confirms a trigger event occurred within the coverage window, the Simplicity smart contract automatically permits the Claim Payout transaction, moving collateral to the insurer. This makes the payout unstoppable and self-enforcing.

### Risk Profile

**What are the risks involved?**

While we eliminate financial counterparty risk through full collateralization, this is a risk-bearing investment. The primary risks are:

- **Principal Loss (Insurance Risk):** If the defined catastrophe occurs (e.g., a major hurricane), the smart contract will liquidate your collateral to pay the insurer. You could lose some or all of your principal.
- **Liquidity Risk:** While we offer secondary market trading via atomic swaps, market liquidity is not guaranteed. You may need to hold the token until maturity.
- **Model Risk:** The premiums are priced based on catastrophe models. These models are probabilistic and may not perfectly predict the frequency or severity of future weather events.

**What happens if Astrolabe goes out of business?**

Your assets are safe. Because the arrangement is structured as a decentralized smart contract on the Liquid blockchain, the custody of funds is not dependent on Astrolabe's continued existence. The Redemption path is hard-coded to allow token holders to burn their tokens and reclaim their bitcoin collateral after the Expiry Date, regardless of Astrolabe's operational status.

### Liquidity

**Can I sell my position before the bond matures?**

Yes. Unlike traditional private reinsurance contracts which are illiquid, the risk asset is issued as a token on the Liquid Network. This enables peer-to-peer trading. You can sell your position to another whitelisted investor using an atomic swap, a single, instantaneous transaction where the risk asset token and the bitcoin payment are exchanged simultaneously. This eliminates settlement delays and settlement risk.
